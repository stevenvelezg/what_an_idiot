About the Project

Have you ever felt like you made a really stupid mistake and feel like a major idiot? Are you just bored and looking for some funny
news articles? Then "What An Idiot!" is the site for you! We take news articles of people who make stupid decisions for your
entertainment!

This site was built between James Lim and I just to have a little fun with our project. We looked around and started to notice all
these serious apps that people were creating and felt that we should be the silly app to lighten the mood. The site itself is pretty
simple, where we make blog posts of different news links we found to be funny because of someone's stupid decisions, allows for voting
by the public, and gives a link to the article.
